Graph Theory Project

Welcome to my README by Michael Cahill – G00374256.
This is my Graph Theory Project submission set by my lecturer Dr. Ian McLoughlin.

How to Use:
Run reg.py with “python3 reg.py” in Debian.

Regular expression:
A regular expression is a method of pattern matching used in programming. They are basically strings that represent patterns of text, the strings can contain special charaters and brackets can be used to group charaters together.
Examples:
a.b.c - a single 'a' followed by a single 'b' followed by a single 'c'.
a.c* - an 'a' followed by zero or by 1 or more 'c' characters.
a|b - an 'a' or 'b'.
(a|b).c - an 'a' or 'b', followed by a 'c'.
Precedence:
1. *
2. .
3. |
4. () - Are used to group individual characters.

Implementation:
Python is one of many that has Recursion.
An NFA is a processor that has states and reads input, each input character potentially setting it into another state.


Research:
For my research on regular expression I mostly referred to the notes on learnonline called "Slides: Regular Expression" and also a few things said in lectures.


The first link is just a link where it showed me how to used a break statement in python. Turned out very similar to Java so there was no hassle
